#MPP-E1180: Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis
</i>
###First Pair Assignment: Ana Cecilia Montes and Ayra Rowena Reyla 
####Introduction and Background Information
This repository is created to perform Assigment 1 for the course introduction to MPP_1180: Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis at Hertie School of Govermance, taught by Prof. Dr. Christopher Gandrud. 

The objective of this pair assignment is to:

1. Create a new public GitHub repository to learn how to use GitHub as an element and for collaborative research
2. Understand basic R structures, code and transformations
3. To implement version controls
4. To develop an understand of new file structres

####Instructions
This repository contains two R codes ("Assigment1_Loblolly.R" and "TreeCode1.R") for the analysis of two data sets "Loblolly" and "Trees". The structure of both R codes is the following:

1. Sets the working directory,
2. Links  codes dynamically (only for file "Assigment1_Loblolly.R"),
3. Loads a R core Data Set, 
4. Conducts descrive statistics.

Finally a file called <i>"Trees_Statistic_Analysis_Document2"<i/> contains a descriptive statistic mixing both dataframes.
